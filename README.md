# Circuit Simulator

## _Assignment no. 2 for  the Research Track 1 course_

### Professor [Carmine Recchiuto](https://github.com/CarmineD8)

The aim of this project is to make a robot move autonomously inside the Monza circuit without hitting the walls.
In particular, we were asked to:
- use ROS for controlling the robot;
- create a node for the control of the robot;
- create an additional node to increase/decrease the velocity and reset the position of the robot.

The following figure shows the circuit that was used for the simulation.
